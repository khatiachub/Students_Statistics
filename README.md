🎓 Student Placement & Internship Performance Dashboard

📊 Project Overview
This project features an interactive data analysis of 5,000 students' academic and professional placement data. The dashboard provides insights into how academic performance (CGPA), internships, and gender influence placement success and salary packages.

🚀 Key Features & Metrics
Core KPI Cards: Instant visibility into Total Students (5,000), Average Placement Status (17%), Average Salary Package (1.60 LPA), and Internship Placement (4%).
Academic Correlation: A "Salary and Placement Success by CGPA Range" chart, showing the direct impact of grades on career outcomes.
Experience Impact: Analysis of how Experience Months and Internship Counts correlate with higher salary offerings.
Demographic Analysis: Placement success broken down by Gender and Attendance levels.
Skill-Based Tracking: Employment status filtered by Technical and Soft Skills proficiency.

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
Multi-Sheet Data Management: Organized data across various analytical tabs including gender_analysis, internship, skills, and cgpa_bands.
Advanced Charting: Created dual-axis charts combining Bar (Placement Status) and Line (Salary Package) graphs for complex comparisons.
Dashboard Design: Implemented a clean, professional UI with consistent branding and easy-to-read KPI blocks.
Data Categorization: Grouping raw student data into logical "Bands" (e.g., CGPA 7-8, 8-9) for better trend visualization.

📈 Key Findings
The "Sweet Spot": Placement success and salary packages significantly peak for students in the 8-10 CGPA range.
Internship Value: Students with 3+ internships show a noticeable increase in placement probability compared to those with zero.
Attendance Factor: Higher attendance levels show a positive correlation with overall placement readiness.
